# That was super easy, I complicated it at first but realized
# I only needed 1 loop.
# A few assumptions made in this program:
#		1. Data inputs are stored at 5000. When it hits a 0, there are no more inputs
#		2. Data outputs are stored at 8192

addi 		$t0, $zero, 8192  		# Pointer for the output
addi 		$t1, $zero, 5000      	# Pointer for the input
addi 		$t2, $zero, 0       	# Running sum

Loop:
	lw		$t3, 0($t1)				# Load input at current memory address, x[i]
	beq		$t3, $zero, End			# If input is 0, End
	add 	$t2, $t2, $t3			# Add input to running sum
	sw		$t2, 0($t0)				# Save current running sum to output
	addi 	$t1, $t1, 4				# Iterate to next read memory address
	addi 	$t0, $t0, 4				# Iterate to next write memory address
	j		Loop					# Repeat Loop
